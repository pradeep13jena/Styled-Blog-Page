        <h1 class="content-head">The city that we love..</h1>
        <p class="content-para">You people must be thinking why there's an entire blog about his city, right? So let me tell you i'm a middle class boy born and baught up in this city. My parents are from small village in Orissa. My father moved in here and later my mother also after their marriage. Before moving any further let me give you a geographical information about this place. So, Thane is a city in Maharastra next to Mumbai. We have river at one side, Mountain covered at another. So you can also imagine the view this city has to offer. You can roam the entire city in 30-40 minute. During rainy season you can go to trek on those beautiful mountain usually it takes 1-1.5 hours to trek all the way up and after trekking theres beautiful Waterfalls where you can rest and enjoy nature and for view you ask? One side you can see entire Thane city and another side Sanjay Gandhi National Park.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="content-para">And apart from this we also have beautifull lake named "Upvan" here where you can do boat ride and the view is just as mesmerising as it can get (I'll put video and images over here). Everytime me or my friends feels low this is where we go and this is every Thanekar's Marine Lines. Two side of the place is covered with mountain and one side with skyscrapper. Dealing with Breakups? Family Issue? Deciding where to go during Weekend? Upvan's your place. During Christmas people get a big screen over here and play movies. Last Christmas it was "The Holiday" & "Holidate". Apart form this, this lake also has it's own water show everyday form 7 to 9. where they show some water show and after that stories about Thane got it's name and how it became what it is today. Not only me but everyone in Thane have the same passion towards this city.

            So out of my all friends two of mine are closest to my heart. Praveen and Pankaj, when i was in 11th and 12th
            every evening all three of us use to go and roam the entire city on our bike and used to debate on Politics, Economy, Girls and many 
            other things. We used to go to one of the mall in the city which is close to our home. This was to be our second home, we used to go
            to dressing room and try all the dresses and click photos. All in all we used to have so much fun, but all the good things have to end,
            right? Both of them moved out, making me the only one here. But no need to worry we still are in contact and meet almost once a week.
            And all three are trying hard to do good in life earn some money so they can move back again and we can enjoy our time again.

            Now, Now, i won't say much about my crush because i can write her so deeply that you'll die to meet her. she is damn beautiful, she friendzoned me
        and (P.S. We don't talk anymore). So you must be thinking why i am writing about my friends and my crush when literally the topic is the city
        the reason is, my love for this city is not only because of the amenities it provides but also due to the beautiful memories 
        i have made in this city. Thane is my Chicago(I hope you get the reference) </br></br> Have i stopped making memories? Absolutely not. I still am 
        with my childhood friends we meet each sunday play cricket, we trek, we watch sport and many more. Lastly i would end this by quoting, 
        <strong>"If someday something happens to me and
        you want to talk to me don't come at my grave, come to Thane"</strong>
